remember that i've a company that is named as enmero and we provide a product named leaf singularity, leaf for short. this product is a type of software that is aimed towards professional works, this software combines a bunch of existing softwares like photoshop, blender, canva, illustrator, after effects, code editor and debugger, preview of the code, slack and many more into a single software that connects all of these into a single eco system, it even has support for multiple people to use it at the same time for colab. it updates in real time and instead of updating the whole thing we just update the part where there's  a change. the main gimick of leaf is its accessable for everyone, bc the process of rendering and process is done on the server side, only the result is shown to the user, hence even people with cheap hardware can use this, now i want to make a website for this, i already have a template can you help me flip it?
